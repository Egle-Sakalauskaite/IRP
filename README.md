Dear recruiters of Vinted Data Science and Analytics Academy,

I want to share an assignment I did with a couple of my coursemates for the Seminar on Quantitative Logistics. The task was to solve an Inventory Routing Problem for a fictional company that delivers medical air to numerous hospitals within a country. Although this was not the 'cleanest' Python code I have written, it is a work I am still very proud of because Inventory Routing problems are known as challenging operations research problems to solve. I led my team in developing a unique heuristic, which gave us an excellent result. This task required much creative problem-solving. I had much fun creating my methodology to tackle the complex issue of visiting each hospital precisely before their medical air tank ran out while keeping the driving distances as efficient as possible. The main application can be found in heuristic.py and heuristic_daily.py
